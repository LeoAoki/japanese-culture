  <p>Japan is a country of drinkers - and a few rituals should be considered before taking a tipple. Never pour a drink for yourself, your friend or host should do this for you and you in turn should keep your companions' glasses filled to the brim! A word you'll hear quite often is kanpai - "cheers" in Japanese.</p>

  <p>Unlike in the West, the culture of going out for just a drink does not really exist in Japan. Drinking is almost always accompanied by a meal or otsumami (a light snack). Otsumami usually comes in the form of a plate of edamame (soy beans), surume (dried shredded squid) or arare (small rice crackers whose name literally translates as hailstones!).</p>

  <p>For tea connoisseurs, Japan is tea heaven. The Japanese word for tea is cha and there are countless varieties ranging from classic green teas through to the more unusual mugicha (barley tea), sobacha (buckwheat tea), genmaicha (brown rice tea), umecha (powdered plum tea) and many more.</p>

  <p class="texto-vinho-claro legenda-texto">Sado (Japanese green tea ceremony) is an ancient tradition with roots traced back to Zen Buddhism. Literally translated as "the way of the tea", the ceremony involves the preparation and drinking of tea.</p>
